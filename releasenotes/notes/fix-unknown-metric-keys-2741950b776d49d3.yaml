    Fixed a bug in the ironic metrics parser where keys without a recognized
    prefix (ironic.api, ironic.drivers.modules, or ironic.conductor) would
    accidentally reuse the formatted_key from the previous loop iteration,
    creating metrics with incorrect names and incomplete labels. Unknown
    metric keys are now properly skipped with a debug log message.

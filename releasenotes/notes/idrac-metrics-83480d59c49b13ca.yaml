features:
  - |
    Adds support for parsing iDRAC sensor data metrics via redfish parser.
    A new metrics `baremetal_temperature_status` was also added.

    Fixed a bug where status metrics failed to differentiate between warning
    and critical states, showing a value of 1 for both. The metrics now show
    a value of 1 for Warning and 2 for Critical.

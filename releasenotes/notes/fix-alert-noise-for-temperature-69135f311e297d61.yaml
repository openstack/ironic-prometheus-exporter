    Some labels can cause Alertmanager to create separate alarm events when
    their values change, even though the alert condition remains the same.
    For `baremetal_temperature_status` we are ignoring the `reading_celsius`,
    for `baremetal_power_status` we are ignoring the `last_power_output_watts`
    and `line_input_voltage`, for `baremetal_fan_status` we are ignoring the
    `reading` and `reading_units`.

    Adds the capability for the ``ironic-prometheus-exporter`` to parse
    metrics data from the ``ironic`` and ``ironic-conductor`` processes
    to enable greater operator insight into the inner working and performance
    of these services. This feature requires the ironic.conf file
    ``[metrics]backend`` value to be set to ``collector``.
